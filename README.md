# KIE Umbrella Site using Hugo testing

Make sure you have `hugo` and `node` installed.
The front-end bits of the theme is put together using webpack and `npm`/`yarn`.
You'll need to 

    cd themes/kie
    yarn install
    yarn build

to build the front-end.
After that from the main directory you can use `hugo serve` to build the site.
